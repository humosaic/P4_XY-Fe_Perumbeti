## Project P4_XY-Fe_Perumbeti
The project is analysis of placental transcriptome data for differences in iron transport gene expression in male and female smokers and non-smokers from 2 GEO dataset 
in Dr. Melissa Wilson's Sayres Lab at A.S.U  

PASSIVE SMOKER EXPOSURE Dataset (18044)
Effect of maternal tobacco smoke exposure on the placental transcriptome, Public on Sep 15, 2009, GSE18044  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18044

ACTIVE SMOKE-RELATED Dataset (27272)
Comprehensive Study of Tobacco Smoke-Related Transcriptome Alterations in Maternal and Fetal Cells, Public on Apr 01, 2011, Series GSE27272

Thank you to Dr. Bruchova for providing investigator annotation for placental sex for the samples.
