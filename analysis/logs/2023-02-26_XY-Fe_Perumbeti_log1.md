## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
This month focused on starting pipeline for GEO data.  I was able to pre-process the GEO data from the Bruchova passive smoker (PS) and active smoker (AS) data set.  I set up github repo for version control: https://github.com/humosaic/P4_XY-Fe_Perumbeti

### Bud: 
I started working on PCA analysis.  

### Thorn: 
I am able to knit to a word document, but getting errors when knitting to PDF.


## Additional thought
I would like to complete PCA analysis, differential expression analysis, and ferroportin and transferrin receptor analysis sorted by smokers for next month.

Next step following this would be joining a table with self report sex information.
Then the 2X2 analysis of sex and smoking status for active smokers and passive smokers.

Ask Dr. Wilson about Comp Life Sci Certificate classes for summer/spring/fall, for bioinformatics pipelines and variant calling.
2 additional study possibilities in progress.
