# Log3 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Prior Log:
#### Prior Log Summary
Read in and tested some pre-processing and pre-analysis code for GEO data from the Bruchova passive smoker (PS) and active smoker (AS) data sets.  
I set up github repo for version control: https://github.com/humosaic/P4_XY-Fe_Perumbeti.
#### Prior Identified Next Steps
Next step following this would be joining a table with self report sex information.
Then the 2X2 analysis of sex and smoking status for active smokers and passive smokers.

### Rose:
1.  Base RMD > 50% complete
2.  Output for correlation heat map and PCA are functional, and can output graphics

### Thorn: 
1.  Knitting for HTML previously working, but now throwing errors.  
2.  Working on differential expression analysis with limma, with partial completion.

## Additional thought
### Next Steps for next month:
1.  Improve visualization for unclustered differentiation
2.  Interpretation of PCA analysis
3.  Complete code for first itteration of Differential expression analysis for smoking groups
4.  Ferroportin and transferrin receptor gene expression analysis, search for additional iron regulatory genes in microarray
7.  Complete the Applied Project proposal
8.  Add self report groups into dataframe
9.  Analyze based on self report groups, and look for table of X expressed genes in microarray.  Screening for XIST1 not present
10. Determine if sex classification matches labeling
11. group by sex and smoking
12. comparative analysis of groups
