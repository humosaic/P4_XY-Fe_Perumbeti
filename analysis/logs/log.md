## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://easyretro.io/templates/rose-bud-thorn/) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
